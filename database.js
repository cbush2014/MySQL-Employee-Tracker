//create a wrapper class for the MySQL client 
// from https://codeburst.io/node-js-mysql-and-promises-4c3be599909b 
//

//The constructor simply creates a new MySQL connection with the given configuration. 
//Note that it doesnâ€™t open the connection yet. 
//The connection is automatically opened when the first query is executed. 
//Thatâ€™s why creating the connection is not an asynchronous operation.
//
//Note that the query() method still returns immediately, before the query is executed. 
//In order to get the results, we have to call the then() method of the returned promise and specify a function that will be called when the query finishes executing.
